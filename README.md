# README #

For this project, we are going to use the results obtained from a previous project (Data weekly update with cron). This data is already in a Database and correspond to the USD-NTD exchange rate retrieved from a bank website.[1]

### What is this repository for? ###

The goal of this project is to find groups in the data (clustering) implementing the K-Means Algorithm, and plot after achieves the result.

* Version 1.1

### What do you need to know?###

* Programming Language: 
  PHP and Javascript.

### What do you need to make the implementation possible? ###

**Tools:**

*    K-Means Algorith PHP Class: [PHP class jacobemerick/kmeans](https://github.com/jacobemerick/kmeans)

*    Visualizing K-Means Clustering: [Javascript Highcharts charting library](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/)
* A Data resource (Database): sql.txt file in the report can help.

Before continuing with the implementation, please take a look at the following [article about K-Means Algorithm Introduction](https://www.datascience.com/blog/introduction-to-k-means-clustering-algorithm-learn-data-science-tutorials.) [2], this will help you to have an idea about what clustering is without knowledge of machine learning.

### K-Means Implementation ###

1. The data source: You can use your own scraping data or use the sql.txt example in this repo.

2. Retrieve the data and create data set.

3. The Result: clusteringall.php file contains how to use the jacobemerick/kmeans [3].Because later will be required a JSON object so we store the results as a JSON object (centroids and clusters).

###Visualizing K-Means Clustering ###

Highchart Implementation Script: The results (centroids and clusters) are stored in different variables to add it to the highchart configuration. We are using Highcharts API please check the references. [4]![all.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/LorRB56/images/3371934390-all.png)
